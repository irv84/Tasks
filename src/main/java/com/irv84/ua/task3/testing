Question.
Our application has to pass integration tests.
Data source for these tests is located on the external test environment.
However, this external test environment allows to run integration test suite against it one at a time.
If several instances are executed against it, test environment crashes and tests will fail randomly.
Please suggest possible solutions how to ensure integration tests will always pass.
Describe pros and cons of these solutions.

Answer.

If there is no possibility / desire to repair the test environment,
I suggest creating a Docker image with the required test environment,
configuring and running the required number of containers, and running
each instance of the integration test with access to a separate instance
of the test environment running in the container with the data.

Plus: Docker is lightweight, you can run the required number of test environments,
 the tests are independent of each other, easy transfer of the image to the entire test environment.
